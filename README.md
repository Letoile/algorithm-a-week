algorithm-a-week
================

Personal project for kill my procrastination and save the brain from drying.

Trying to write one algorithm in Python a week. Starts from very simple things that I really know at first (just for not to scare myself :D), and finishes (finish? :D) with complex mathematical problems.

N.B. Don't forget about unit tests

**week1** — Bubble Sort

**week2** — Exponentiation by squaring

**week3** — Fast tree factorization
